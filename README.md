# Real-Time Retail Analytics and Product Recommender

This project proposes the development of a real-time analytics and recommendation system for ecommerce platforms. By analyzing customer behavior, product metadata, and transactional
records, the system will predict buying intent, cluster similar users, and recommend relevant
products. The architecture will evolve through deep learning, similarity-based search, Transformer
applications, hypothesis testing, and recommender engines.

Milestone Tasks:
- Milestone 1 – Neural Network Workflow (PyTorch): Train deep learning models to predict
purchasing behavior and customer retention based on session logs and historical purchase
data.
- Milestone 2 – Similarity Search: Use high-dimensional similarity search to identify
customers with comparable behavior, enabling collaborative trends and tailored
suggestions
- Milestone 4 – Large-Scale Hypothesis Testing: Conduct large-scale A/B testing to assess
the impact of promotional strategies or UI changes on purchasing behavior, using scalable
p-value corrections.
- Milestone 5 – Recommendation Systems: Build a hybrid recommender system that
combines collaborative filtering with content-based techniques to deliver relevant and
personalized product recommendations.
